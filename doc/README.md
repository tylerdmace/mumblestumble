# Mumblestumble Documentation

## Overview
Because of the compact nature of confidentail transactions with cut-through, we're able to run every wallet as a full node without having to worry about the space and resource constraints we'd normally have to work around.

To begin we will require both wallets to be online in order for a transaction to be crafted. We will look into something like SBBS in the future.

Our currency is going to be called ```Trips``` with it's smallest atomic units called ```Stumbles```.
